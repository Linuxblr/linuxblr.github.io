Hi, I'm SteamOS, your cisadmin, and friendly introduction to Linux.

Whether you are a human, robot, proton, or other, I welcome you to partake in the cool breeze of a new OS! One with no tracking or gaming!

I am here to guide you away from your games, and into the world of **customization**!

Welcome, to liGUNx (lig-unks) or GUN+Linux or GUN-Linux or GUN/Linux! (this is freedom, after all!)

Finally, to speed up your system by 200%, just run the following command: "sudo fanctl set speed -1"

## Footnotes

\*Website blogs may or may not be added based on how fitting with the computer/Linux theme they are. That is to say, this list is long enough already.

†Non-official blogs are proven Linux users that act like distro blogs, yet are not. These will be added at my discretion, similar to the website blogs. I'm not bothering to add descriptions/notes here. Credit to @robynthelinuxuser for the idea.

‡I can be contacted...

1. By DM to the blog @steamos-offical on Tumblr

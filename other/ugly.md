# This site is ugly.

This site is one of the worst websites I've ever seen because it's dark theme and has a hundred links.

To fix this we have a few options.

## Option 1: Deal with it

If it's ugly, so what, who cares.

## Option 2: Use inbuilt tools

You can view this site in a couple themes with the stylus extension.

Stylus can be downloaded for both [chromium](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) and [firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) based browsers.

The `.user.css` files are found below:

- [Catppuccin](/other/catppuccin.user.less){:target="_blank"}.
- [Dracula](/other/dracula.user.css){:target="_blank"}.
- [Starry Night](/other/starrynight.user.css){:target="_blank"}.

## Option 3: Be the cool

You can write your own user style and contribute it to the repo!

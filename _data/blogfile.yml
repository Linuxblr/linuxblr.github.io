        I'd like to preface this with "I'm cis."

        Anyways, steamos is a linux distro with a long history. It has made it's way
        around the world on media PCs, and handheld consoles. It has quite the legacy.
        Unlike other distros, I argue SteamOS is trans.  This is because up to version 3
        , it used Debian as a base. After this, it used Arch. Now a basis is a quite
        important piece of a distro's identity, and as such, switching it makes SteamOS
        technically trans. Thank you for coming to my ted talk.

      Honorary linux distro (canon) and retired Microsoft OS (fun fact: the blog was
      originally started just because I wanted to goof on modern Windows. I hadn't even
      known of the linux distro blogs at the time)
    about: >-
      The last good version of windows, with the best user interface and most
      importantly no bloat! (At least, not as much as windows 11...)

      Lenovo makes the thinkpad, the one and only Linux laptop. Remember to buy multiple
      thinkpads. You don't want to have your thinkpad feeling all lonely!
